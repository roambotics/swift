// swift-tools-version: 5.6

// The CMake build system is the only one that's able to produce a working
// compiler. This Package.swift makes it easier to build and work with the
// swiftASTGen library within IDEs, but it's mainly there for editing---it
// won't create something that can be meaningfully executed. Most things with
// the new Swift parser are better implemented/tested within or on top of the
// swift-syntax package.
