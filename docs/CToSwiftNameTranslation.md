# Name Translation from C to Swift

This document gives a high-level description of how C and Objective-C declarations are translated to Swift, with particular focus on how names are adjusted. It is not attempting to be a *complete* description of everything the compiler does except with regards to how *names* are transformed; even there, some special cases that only apply to Apple's SDKs have been omitted. The example code shown is for illustrative purposes and does not always include all parts of an imported API's interface.

## Word boundaries

Several forms of name translation are defined in terms of word boundaries. The word-splitting algorithm used by the Swift compiler is as follows: there is a boundary after

1. An underscore ("\_").
2. A series of two or more uppercase ASCII characters and the suffix "s", "es", or "ies" (e.g. "URLs", "VAXes")...unless the last uppercase letter is "I" and the suffix is "s", in which case it's just as likely to be an acronym followed by "Is" (i.e. "URLIs" is treated as "URL Is").
2. A series of two or more uppercase ASCII characters followed by an uppercase ASCII character and then a lowercase ASCII character ("XMLReader" becomes "XML Reader").
3. A series of two or more uppercase ASCII characters followed by a non-ASCII-alphabetic character. ("UTF8" becomes "UTF 8")
4. A series of two or more uppercase ASCII characters at the end of the string.
5. An uppercase ASCII character and any number of non-ASCII-uppercase, non-underscore characters ("ContrivedExample" becomes "Contrived Example").
6. Any number of non-ASCII-uppercase, non-underscore characters ("lowercase\_example" becomes "lowercase \_ example").


## Enums

1. Anonymous? Import elements as constants of the underlying type, *except* that Int is used for an inferred underlying type if all the cases fit in an Int32, since integer conversions are explicit in Swift.
2. `ns_error_domain` attribute? Import as an error struct (see below)
3. `flag_enum` attribute? Import as an option set struct (see below)
4. `enum_extensibility` attribute? Import as an `@objc` enum, whether open or closed
5. Otherwise, import as a RawRepresentable struct _without renaming constants_ (this is probably an oversight but would be source-breaking to change)

An enum declared as `typedef enum { â€¦ } MyEnum;` is not considered "anonymous"; the typedef name is used instead. This interpretation has precedent in the C++ linkage rules, which have a similar special case for typedefs of unnamed enums (C++17 [dcl.typedef]p9).

### `@objc` enums

```objc
enum TimeOfDay __attribute__((enum_extensibility(open))) : long {
  TimeOfDayMorning,
  TimeOfDayAfternoon,
  TimeOfDayNight,
  TimeOfDayEvening = TimeOfDayNight
};
// Most commonly seen as NS_ENUM and NS_CLOSED_ENUM.
```

```swift
@objc enum TimeOfDay: Int {
  init?(rawValue: Int)
  var rawValue: Int { get }

  case morning
  case afternoon
  case night

  static var evening: TimeOfDay { get }
}
```

- Enum name is enum name.
- Underlying type becomes raw type.
- Case names follow the rules for "enum-style prefix stripping" below.
- `init?(rawValue:)` currently does not check cases, but probably should for "closed" enums (Clang's equivalent of `@frozen`)

In order to deal with cases with the same underlying value, the importer picks a set of _canonical cases_ by walking the enum and recording the first *available* enumerator with a particular value. (Note that deprecated cases are still considered available unless they were deprecated for a platform older than Swift's earliest deployment targets, OS X 10.9 and iOS 7.) Any "non-canonical" cases are imported as computed properties instead.

### Error enum structs

```objc
enum VagueFailureCode __attribute__((ns_error_domain(VagueFailureDomain))) : long {
  VagueFailureBadness,
  VagueFailureWorseness,
  VagueFailureWorstness
};
// Most commonly seen as NS_ERROR_ENUM.
```

```swift
struct VagueFailure: Error {
  @objc enum Code: Int {
    init?(rawValue: Int)
    var rawValue: Int { get }

    case badness
    case worseness
    case worstness

    typealias ErrorType = VagueFailure
  }

  static var badness: VagueFailure.Code { get }
  static var worseness: VagueFailure.Code { get }
  static var worstness: VagueFailure.Code { get }

  static var errorDomain: String { get }
}
```

- Struct name is enum name, dropping the suffix "Code" if present.
- Original enum type is mapped to the nested "Code" enum using the rules for "`@objc` enums".
- Struct gets an `errorDomain` member populated from the `ns_error_domain` attribute.
- Struct gets aliases for the enum cases as static properties for easier use in `catch` clauses.

### Option set structs

```objc
enum PetsAllowed __attribute__((flag_enum)) : long {
  PetsAllowedNone = 0,
  PetsAllowedDogs = 1 << 0,
  PetsAllowedCats = 1 << 1
};
// Most commonly seen as NS_OPTIONS.
```

```swift
struct PetsAllowed: OptionSet {
  init(rawValue: Int)
  var rawValue: Int

  static var dogs: PetsAllowed { get }
  static var cats: PetsAllowed { get }
}
```

- Struct name is enum name.
- Underlying type becomes raw type.
- Cases are imported as static properties.
- Case names follow the rules for "enum-style prefix stripping" below.
- Cases with a raw value of `0` are **not imported** unless the case has an explicit `swift_name` attribute. (The intent is to use `[]` instead in Swift, representing "no options".)

### Enum-style prefix stripping

In C, enumerators (enum cases) aren't namespaced under their enum type, so their names have to make sense in a global context. The Swift compiler attempts to recognize several common idioms for ASCII-based names in order to translate these into idiomatic Swift members.

1. Collect all *available, non-deprecated* enum cases *without custom names.* If there are no such cases, collect all cases without custom names, whether available or not.

2. Find the common word-boundary prefix __CP__ of these cases.

3. If __CP__ starts with "k" followed by an uppercase letter, or if it's *just* "k" and none of the cases have a non-identifier-start character immediately after the 'k', treat that as meaning "constant" and ignore it for the next step.

4. Find the common word-boundary prefix __EP__ of __CP__ and the type's original C name (rather than its Swift name).

5. If the next word of __CP__ after __EP__ is

    - the next word of the type's original C name minus "s" ("URL" vs. "URLs")
    - the next word of the type's original C name minus "es" ("Address" vs. "Addresses")
    - the next word of the type's original C name with "ies" replaced by "y" ("Property" vs. "Properties")

    add the next word of __CP__ to __EP__.

6. If the next word of __CP__ after __EP__ is an underscore ("MyEnum\_FirstCase" vs. "MyEnum"), add the underscore to __EP__.

7. If "k" was dropped from __CP__ in step 3, add it back to the front of __EP__.

8. For any case without a custom name, if it starts with __EP__, drop __EP__ from that case's name when importing it. (Deprecated or unavailable cases may not start with __EP__ depending on step 1.)

9. ASCII-lowercase the first word of the remaining name if it starts with an uppercase ASCII character.

    _There's a bug in this step where the special case for "Is" is missing, so "URLIs" will be lowercased to "urlis"._

## `swift_wrapper` typedefs

The `swift_wrapper` Clang attribute allows importing a typedef as a RawRepresentable struct type; it also causes global constants that use that type name to be imported as members of the new struct type.

```objc
typedef NSString * _Nonnull SecretResourceID __attribute__((swift_wrapper(struct)));

extern SecretResourceID const SecretResourceTreasureChest;
extern SecretResourceID const SecretResourceBankVault;

// Usually seen as NS_TYPED_ENUM and NS_TYPED_EXTENSIBLE_ENUM.
```

```swift
struct SecretResourceID: RawRepresentable, Hashable {
  typealias RawValue = String

  init(_ rawValue: String)
  init(rawValue: String)
  var rawValue: String { get }
}

extension SecretResourceID {
  static var treasureChest: SecretResource { get }
  static var bankVault: SecretResource { get }
}
```

- If the underlying type conforms to Equatable or Hashable, or is bridged to Objective-C, the wrapper type will too.
- The unlabeled `init(_:)` is only created when the Clang attribute is `swift_wrapper(struct)` rather than `swift_wrapper(enum)`.
- The constant names are imported using a simplified version of enum-style prefix stripping unless they have a custom name:

    1. If the constant name starts with "k" followed by an uppercase letter, treat that as meaning "constant" and ignore it for the next step.
    2. Find the common word-boundary prefix __P__ of the constant name and the typedef's original C name (rather than its Swift name).
    3. If "k" was dropped from the constant name in step 1, add it back to the front of __P__.
    4. Drop __P__ from the constant's name.
    5. ASCII-lowercase the first word of the remaining name if it starts with an uppercase ASCII character.

    _This default translation may result in a name that is not a valid identifier, in which case a custom name must be applied in order to reference the constant from Swift._

### NSNotificationName

On Apple platforms, whenever Foundation is imported, constants with the type "NSNotificationName" additionally have the suffix "Notification" stripped before performing the above rules unless they have a custom name. Global NSString constants whose name ends in "Notification" will also automatically be treated as if they were declared with the type NSNotificationName unless they have a custom name.


## Objective-C Protocols

Protocols in Objective-C are normally in a separate namespace from the "ordinary" identifier namespace used by typedefs and classes. Swift does not have separate namespaces, so if the protocol has the same name as another declaration in the same module, the suffix "Protocol" is appended. (Example: NSObjectProtocol in the ObjectiveC module.)


## CF Types

"Core Foundation" is a C-based object-oriented system with strong conventions built around pointers to opaque structs. Creating new Core Foundation types is not generally supported, but Swift will recognize those in Apple's SDKs. If a struct has the `objc_bridge`, `objc_mutable_bridge`, or `objc_bridge_related` Clang attributes, it will be treated as a CF type and a typedef of a pointer to that struct will be imported as a class in Swift. The suffix "Ref" will be dropped from the class's name if present unless doing so would conflict with another declaration in the same module as the typedef.

If the class name contains the word "Mutable" exactly once per the usual word-boundary rules, a corresponding class name without the word "Mutable" will be used as the superclass if present. Otherwise, the CF type is taken to be a root object.

Additionally, typedefs for `void *` or `const void *` that are themselves annotated with `objc_bridge` will be treated as CFTypeRef-like and imported as `Any` rather than `Unsafe[Mutable]RawPointer`.

If a typedef's underlying type is itself a "CF pointer" typedef, the "alias" typedef will be imported as a regular typealias, with the suffix "Ref" still dropped from its name (if present) unless doing so would conflict with another declaration in the same module as the typedef.


## Objective-C Properties

By default, most property names are not transformed at all. However, if the getter of a property overrides a superclass or adopted protocol method that is also a property accessor, the Swift name of the overridden accessor's property will be used for consistency. If there's more than one such name, one is chosen arbitrarily.

Properties with the type `BOOL` or `Boolean` use the name of the getter as the name of the Swift property by default, rather than the name of the property in Objective-C. This accounts for a difference in Swift and Objective-C naming conventions for boolean properties that use "is".

```objc
@property(getter=isContrivedExample) BOOL contrivedExample;
@property BOOL hasAnotherForm;
```

```swift
var isContrivedExample: Bool { get set }
var hasAnotherForm: Bool { get set }
```

_This rule should probably have applied to C's native `bool` as well._

A property declaration with the `SwiftImportPropertyAsAccessors` API note will not be imported at all, and its accessors will be imported as methods. Additionally, properties whose names start with "accessibility" in the NSAccessibility protocol are always imported as methods, as are properties whose names start with "accessibility" in an `@interface` declaration (class or category) that provides the adoption of NSAccessibility.

_Objective-C code has historically not been consistent about whether the NSAccessibility declarations should be considered properties and therefore the Swift compiler chooses to import them as methods, as a sort of lowest common denominator._


## `swift_private`

The `swift_private` Clang attribute prepends `__` onto the base name of any declaration being imported except initializers. For initializers with no arguments, a dummy `Void` argument with the name `__` is inserted; otherwise, the label for the first argument has `__` prepended. This transformation takes place after any other name manipulation, unless the declaration has a custom name. It will not occur if the declaration is an override; in that case the name needs to match the overridden declaration.

```objc
@interface Example : NSObject
- (instancetype)initWithValue:(int)value __attribute__((swift_private));
@property(readonly) int value __attribute__((swift_private));
@end

// Usually seen as NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT
```

```swift
class Example: NSObject {
  init(__value: Int32)
  var __value: Int32 { get }
}
```

The purpose of this annotation is to allow a more idiomatic implementation to be provided in Swift. The effect of `swift_private` is inherited from an enum onto its elements if the enum is not imported as an error code enum, an `@objc` enum, or an option set.

_The original intent of the `swift_private` attribute was additionally to limit access to a Swift module with the same name as the owning Clang module, e.g. the Swift half of a mixed-source framework. However, this restriction has not been implemented as of Swift 5.1._

_For "historical reasons", the `swift_private` attribute is ignored on factory methods with no arguments imported as initializers. This is essentially matching the behavior of older Swift compilers for source compatibility in case someone has marked such a factory method as `swift_private`._


## Custom names

The `swift_name` Clang attribute can be used to control how a declaration imports into Swift. If it's valid, the value of the `swift_name` attribute always overrides any other name transformation rules (prefix-stripping, underscore-prepending, etc.)

### Types and globals

The `swift_name` attribute can be used to give a type or a global a custom name. In the simplest form, the value of the attribute must be a valid Swift identifier.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("SpacecraftCoordinates")))
struct SPKSpacecraftCoordinates {
  double x, y, z, t; // space and time, of course
};

// Usually seen as NS_SWIFT_NAME.
```

```swift
struct SpacecraftCoordinates {
  var x, y, z, t: Double
}
```

### Import-as-member

A custom name that starts with an identifier followed by a period is taken to be a member name. The identifier should be the imported Swift name of a C/Objective-C type in the same module. In this case, the type or global will be imported as a static member of the named type.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("SpacecraftCoordinates.earth")))
extern const struct SPKSpacecraftCoordinates SPKSpacecraftCoordinatesEarth;
```

```swift
extension SpacecraftCoordinates {
  static var earth: SpacecraftCoordinates { get }
}
```

Note that types cannot be imported as members of protocols.

_The "in the same module" restriction is considered a technical limitation; a forward declaration of the base type will work around it._


### C functions with custom names

The `swift_name` attribute can be used to give a C function a custom name. The value of the attribute must be a full Swift function name, including parameter labels.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("doSomething(to:bar:)")))
void doSomethingToFoo(Foo *foo, int bar);
```

```swift
func doSomething(to foo: UnsafeMutablePointer<Foo>, bar: Int32)
```

An underscore can be used in place of an empty parameter label, as in Swift.

A C function with zero arguments and a non-`void` return type can also be imported as a computed variable by using the `getter:` prefix on the name. A function with one argument and a `void` return type can optionally serve as the setter for that variable using `setter:`.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("getter:globalCounter()")))
int getGlobalCounter(void);
__attribute__((swift_name("setter:globalCounter(_:)")))
void setGlobalCounter(int newValue);
```

```swift
var globalCounter: Int32 { get set }
```

Note that the argument lists must still be present even though the name used is the name of the variable. (Also note the `void` parameter list to specify a C function with zero arguments. This is required!)

Variables with setters and no getters are not supported.


#### Import-as-member

Like types and globals, functions can be imported as static members of types.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("NSSound.beep()")))
void NSBeep(void);
```

```swift
extension NSSound {
  static func beep()
}
```

However, by giving a parameter the label `self`, a function can also be imported as an instance member of a type __T__. In this case, the parameter labeled `self` must either have the type __T__ itself, or be a pointer to __T__. The latter is only valid if __T__ is imported as a value type; if the pointer is non-`const`, the resulting method will be `mutating`. If __T__ is a class, the function will be `final`.

```objc
typedef struct {
  int value;
} Counter;

__attribute__((swift_name("Counter.printValue(self:)")))
void CounterPrintValue(Counter c);
__attribute__((swift_name("Counter.printValue2(self:)")))
void CounterPrintValue2(const Counter *c);
__attribute__((swift_name("Counter.resetValue(self:)")))
void CounterResetValue(Counter *c);
```

```swift
struct Counter {
  var value: Int32 { get set }
}

extension Counter {
  func printValue()
  func printValue2()
  mutating func resetValue()
}
```

This also applies to getters and setters, to be imported as instance properties.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("getter:Counter.absoluteValue(self:)")))
int CounterGetAbsoluteValue(Counter c);
```

```swift
extension Counter {
  var absoluteValue: Int32 { get }
}
```

Finally, functions can be imported as initializers as well by using the base name `init`. These are considered "factory" initializers and are never inherited or overridable. They must not have a `self` parameter.

```objc
__attribute__((swift_name("Counter.init(initialValue:)")))
Counter CounterCreateWithInitialValue(int value);
```

```swift
extension Counter {
  /* non-inherited */ init(initialValue value: Int32)
}
```


### Enumerators (enum cases)

The `swift_name` attribute can be used to rename enumerators. As mentioned above, not only does no further prefix-stripping occur on the resulting name, but the presence of a custom name removes the enum case from the computation of a prefix for the other cases.

```
// Actual example from Apple's SDKs; in fact, the first shipping example of
// swift_name on an enumerator at all!
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, NSXMLNodeKind) {
  NSXMLInvalidKind = 0,
  NSXMLDocumentKind,
  NSXMLElementKind,
  NSXMLAttributeKind,
  NSXMLNamespaceKind,
  NSXMLProcessingInstructionKind,
  NSXMLCommentKind,
  NSXMLTextKind,
  NSXMLDTDKind NS_SWIFT_NAME(DTDKind),
  NSXMLEntityDeclarationKind,
  NSXMLAttributeDeclarationKind,
  NSXMLElementDeclarationKind,
  NSXMLNotationDeclarationKind
};
```

```
public enum Kind : UInt {
  case invalid
  case document
  case element
  case attribute
  case namespace
  case processingInstruction
  case comment
  case text
  case DTDKind
  case entityDeclaration
  case attributeDeclaration
  case elementDeclaration
  case notationDeclaration
}
```

Although enumerators always have global scope in C, they are often imported as members in Swift, and thus the `swift_name` attribute cannot be used to import them as members of another type unless the enum type is anonymous.

_Currently, `swift_name` does not even allow importing an enum case as a member of the enum type itself, even if the enum is not recognized as an `@objc` enum, error code enum, or option set (i.e. the situation where a case is imported as a global constant)._


### Fields of structs and unions; Objective-C properties

The `swift_name` attribute can be applied to rename a struct or union field or an Objective-C property (whether on a class or a protocol). The value of the attribute must be a valid Swift identifier.

```objc
struct SPKSpaceflightBooking {
  const SPKLocation * _Nullable destination;
  bool roundTrip __attribute__((swift_name("isRoundTrip")));
};
```

```swift
struct SPKSpaceflightBooking {
  var destination: UnsafePointer<SPKLocation>?
  var isRoundTrip: Bool
}
```


### Objective-C methods

The `swift_name` attribute can be used to give an Objective-C method a custom name. The value of the attribute must be a full Swift function name, including parameter labels.

```objc
- (void)doSomethingToFoo:(Foo *)foo bar:(int)bar
  __attribute__((swift_name("doSomethingImportant(to:bar:)")));
```

```swift
func doSomethingImportant(to foo: UnsafeMutablePointer<Foo>, bar: Int32)
```

As with functions, an underscore can be used to represent an empty parameter label.

Methods that follow the NSError out-parameter convention may provide one fewer parameter label than the number of parameters in the original method to indicate that a parameter should be dropped, but they do not have to. The `swift_error` attribute is still respected even when using a custom name for purposes of transforming an NSError out-parameter and the method return type.

```objc
- (BOOL)doSomethingRiskyAndReturnError:(NSError **)error
  __attribute__((swift_name("doSomethingRisky()")));
- (BOOL)doSomethingContrived:(NSString *)action error:(NSError **)outError
  __attribute__((swift_name("doSomethingContrived(_:error:)")));
```

```swift
func doSomethingRisky() throws
func doSomethingContrived(_ action: String, error: ()) throws
```

A base name of "init" can be used on a *class* method that returns `instancetype` or the containing static type in order to import that method as an initializer. Any other custom name *prevents* a class method from being imported as an initializer even if it would normally be inferred as one.

```objc
+ (Action *)makeActionWithHandler:(void(^)(void))handler
  __attribute__((swift_name("init(handler:)")));
+ (instancetype)makeActionWithName:(NSString *)name
  __attribute__((swift_name("init(name:)")));
```

```swift
/* non-inherited */ init(handler: () -> Void)
init(name: String)
```

A no-argument method imported as an initializer can be given a dummy argument label to disambiguate it from the no-argument `init()`, whether the method is an init-family instance method or a factory class method in Objective-C.

```objc
- (instancetype)initSafely
  __attribute__((swift_name("init(safe:)")));
+ (instancetype)makeDefaultAction
  __attribute__((swift_name("init(default:)")));
```

```swift
init(safe: ())
init(default: ())
```

A custom name on an instance method with one of Objective-C's subscript selectors (`objectAtIndexedSubscript:`, `objectForKeyedSubscript:`, `setObject:atIndexedSubscript:`, or `setObject:forKeyedSubscript:`) prevents that method from being imported as a subscript or used as the accessor for another subscript.

_Currently, this only works if *both* methods in a read/write subscript are given custom names; if just one is, a read/write subscript will still be formed. A read-only subscript only has one method to rename._


## More to come...
