// Welcome, Build Wrangler!
//
// This file lists APIs that are unique to stdlib builds with assertions.
// (It is combined with the stability-stdlib-abi-without-asserts.test file
// to generate a full list of potentially breaking API changes. In most cases
// you'll want to edit that file instead of this one.)
//
// A failure in this test indicates that there is a potential breaking change in
// the Standard Library. If you observe a failure outside of a PR test, please
// reach out to the Standard Library team directly to make sure this gets
// resolved quickly! If your own PR fails in this test, you probably have an
// ABI- or source-breaking change in your commits. Please go and fix it.
//
// Please DO NOT DISABLE THIS TEST. In addition to ignoring the current set of
// ABI breaks, XFAILing this test also silences any future ABI breaks that may
// land on this branch, which simply generates extra work for the next person
// that picks up the mess.
//
// Instead of disabling this test, consider extending the list of expected
// changes at the bottom. (You'll also need to do this if your own PR triggers
// false positives, or if you have special permission to break things.) You can
// find a diff of what needs to be added in the output of the failed test run.
// The order of lines doesn't matter, and you can also include comments to refer
// to any bugs you filed.
//
// Thank you for your help ensuring the stdlib remains compatible with its past!
//                                            -- Your friendly stdlib engineers

// We currently only have a baseline for Intel CPUs on macOS.
// REQUIRES: OS=macosx
// REQUIRES: CPU=x86_64 || CPU=arm64
// NOTE: This test runs both on intel and arm, and so far no differences have been spotted,
//       so for better developer experience on apple silicon macs at desk we don't require a specific architecture.
//       If there were to be a case where it fails on one of the platforms, we'd have to potentially split out into an arm baseline file.

Func MainActor.run(resultType:body:) has generic signature change from <T where T : Swift.Sendable> to <T>
Func MainActor.run(resultType:body:) has mangled name changing from 'static Swift.MainActor.run<A where A: Swift.Sendable>(resultType: A.Type, body: @Swift.MainActor @Sendable () throws -> A) async throws -> A' to 'static Swift.MainActor.run<A>(resultType: A.Type, body: @Swift.MainActor @Sendable () throws -> A) async throws -> A'
Func _asyncLet_get(_:_:) has mangled name changing from '_Concurrency._asyncLet_get(Builtin.RawPointer, Builtin.RawPointer) async -> Builtin.RawPointer' to '_Concurrency._asyncLet_get(Builtin.RawPointer, Builtin.RawPointer) async -> ()'
Func _asyncLet_get(_:_:) has return type change from Builtin.RawPointer to ()

Protocol Actor has added inherited protocol AnyActor
Protocol Actor has generic signature change from <Self : AnyObject, Self : Swift.Sendable> to <Self : _Concurrency.AnyActor>
Struct CheckedContinuation has removed conformance to UnsafeSendable

// SerialExecutor gained `enqueue(_: __owned Job)`, protocol requirements got default implementations
Func SerialExecutor.enqueue(_:) has been added as a protocol requirement

// We deprecated `enqueue(_: UnownedJob)` and annotate it as such for all platforms,
// while adding a new overload that accepts `Job` with new availability.
// The ABI checker seems to be confused by this case.
// rdar://106833284 (ABI checker confused with overload getting deprecated)
Func Executor.enqueue(_:) is a new API without @available attribute

// This function correctly inherits its availability from the TaskLocal struct.
Func TaskLocal.withValueImpl(_:operation:file:line:) is a new API without @available attribute
